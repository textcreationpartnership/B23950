            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An ACCOUNT of an APPARITION That appeared to TITUS OATES.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>SOme night late paſt, as I <hi>(accurſed)</hi> lay,</l>
               <l>Tumbling and Toſſing, wiſhing long for day;</l>
               <l>Juſt fallen into a Sleep, I did Eſpy</l>
               <l>(Methought) ſome frightful Things approaching nye</l>
               <l>My trembling Bed: Thoſe who at firſt appear'd,</l>
               <l>Were naked Men with <hi>Crimſon Blood</hi> beſmeer'd,</l>
               <l>Dragging their Bowells trayling at their Heel,</l>
               <l>Their Breaſts ript open, wanted Hearts to feel:</l>
               <l>They gently came, and drew near to my Bed,</l>
               <l>Shew'd what, and who they were but nothing ſaid;</l>
               <l>At which I then (though ne're before) turn'd red:</l>
               <l>In every Geſture you might plainly find,</l>
               <l>A Soul compos'd, and a well order'd mind,</l>
               <l>They knew me not, their Thoughts did ſoar more high,</l>
               <l>Their Eyes and Thoughts were fix'd above the Sky:</l>
               <l>But with true Conſort each did Sing this Song,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>O Lord moſt Holy, Lord moſt Juſt, how long?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Juſt following them, came Two ſo cloſely joyn'd</l>
               <l>As Matrimonial Bands had e're deſign'd;</l>
               <l>For Man and Wife, (Perhaps they ſo might be,)</l>
               <l>The one dreſt Man-like, t'other contrary;</l>
               <l>The Robes he wore were of a <hi>Scarlet dye,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Of Aſpect Reverend, full of Gravity:</l>
               <l>In whoſe right Hand faſt held (me thought) I ſaw</l>
               <l>A Book, Intituled, <hi>Govern by the Law.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Her Dreſs as <hi>Veſtal Nuns</hi> are made to wear,</l>
               <l>From Head to Foot, did purely White appear;</l>
               <l>Whoſe Eyes were Cover'd with the Fineſt Lawn;</l>
               <l>In her right Hand a Naked Sword was drawn,</l>
               <l>Pointed towards me, at which I trembled more,</l>
               <l>Then at the Bleeding ſight I nam'd before.</l>
               <l>As if ſhe knew me, ſhe did boldly come,</l>
               <l>Inquir'd for <hi>Conſcience,</hi> I reply'd, <hi>from home;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Quoth ſhe, <hi>How long? I</hi> ſaid, <hi>I cou'd not tell,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>She very ſeldom us'd with Me to dwell.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then with a Bold (<hi>I</hi> thought commanding) word</l>
               <l>To th' Scarlet Gown cryes, <hi>Judgment</hi> give my Lord.</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:206097:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <l>He ſeem'd reſerv'd, and would but little ſay,</l>
               <l>Yet ſhook his Head, Look'd Stearn, and went away,</l>
               <l>With threatning Signs of a ſeverer day.</l>
               <l>At whch I wak'd from that moſt diſmal Dream.</l>
               <l>And thus <hi>I</hi> write upon the Tragyck Theme.</l>
               <l>Alas thoſe inward Pangs I hourly feel,</l>
               <l>Are now grown greater than <hi>I</hi> can reveal,</l>
               <l>None e're more ſenſibly than <hi>I,</hi> cou'd tell,</l>
               <l>How like a wounded Conſcience is to Hell:</l>
               <l>My crying Crimes, like Vipers dayly tear</l>
               <l>My Bleeding Intralls, and I'm all diſpair:</l>
               <l>The Fate of <hi>Judas</hi> was more mild than mine,</l>
               <l>He ſhew'd Repentance of his Treacherous Crime:</l>
               <l>Favour was granted to that <hi>Curſed Elf,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And ſtrength of Mind enough to hang Himſelf.</l>
               <l>But <hi>I</hi> more miſerable far than He</l>
               <l>Who dare not do what none will do for me,</l>
               <l>Ungrateful <hi>Ketch</hi> where's thy Civility!</l>
               <l>You know that lately, might <hi>I</hi> had my Will,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Cornishes</hi> and <hi>Bethels</hi> Sheriffs ſtill,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I</hi> wou'd have ſworn whilſt Death had Power to Kill,</l>
               <l>And was in all Superlatively ill.</l>
               <l>For <hi>I,</hi> more fierce than all the Devils, hurl'd,</l>
               <l>And ſtrove to turn to <hi>Chaos</hi> all the World:</l>
               <l>For which I'm Plagu'd, and Burn with more than fire,</l>
               <l>By the ſtrict Vengeance of th' <hi>Almighties Ire.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To Heaven <hi>I</hi> dare not look, that Glorious Throne</l>
               <l>Did evermore my <hi>Hateful Crimes</hi> diſown.</l>
               <l>Th' Infernal Spirits ſeem to dread me too,</l>
               <l>Or envy that my <hi>Crimes</hi> did Theirs out-do.</l>
               <l>Proſcrib'd by all, <hi>Where Wretched ſhall I flye?</hi>
               </l>

               <l>—But hold, have <hi>I</hi> not read</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Pythagoras</hi> Faith, and what th' <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſaid</l>

               <l>Into ſome <hi>Birds</hi> or <hi>Beaſts,</hi> alas! What then?</l>
